Ordinals Protocol allows users to embed data into the BTC Blockchain. Bitcoin Ordinals refer to the Bitcoin digital artifacts created by inscribing arbitrary content to satoshis. Satoshis are the smallest unit of Bitcoin (1 BTC = 100,000,000 sats), and each satoshi is labelled with a unique ordinal number **Ordinal** based on the order they are mined and transferred in subsequent transactions. Unlike Ethereum NFTs, inscriptions are always **immutable** and **on-chain** meaning that the embedded content can never be changed or removed.
