The Ordinals Protocol enables users to embed data directly into the BTC Blockchain. These embedded pieces of data are known as Bitcoin Ordinals, which are digital artifacts formed by inscribing content onto satoshis. A satoshi, being the smallest unit of Bitcoin (1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis), is assigned a unique ordinal number based on the sequence in which it was mined and subsequently transferred. This method contrasts with Ethereum NFTs in a significant way: inscriptions on the BTC Blockchain are always **immutable** and **on-chain**. This ensures that once content is embedded, it cannot be altered or removed.[[1]](https://docs.ordinals.com/)
